There are folders for each HPC platform used in the computation:
phi: the intel phi coprocessors (4 x 64 cores)
bd: the big dawg cluster up to 192 intel cores
bd-2: the new big dawg cluster of 5 AMD processors with 112 cores each - 4 x 112 were used in the computation
gadi: the GADI system provided by NCI Australia

The code here was adapted from the olc repository
